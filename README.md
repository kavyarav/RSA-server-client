RSA-server-client
================

This project is for ensures secure communication using sockets in C/C++ using the RSA encryption-decryption algorithm. The sender runs the server code and the rreceiver runs the client code. The authenticity of the sender is checked using a digital signature scheme using the SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm).
